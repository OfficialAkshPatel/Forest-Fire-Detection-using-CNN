# Forest-Fire-Detection-using-CNN-
This project is an attempt to use CNN to detect the presence or the start  of a forest fire in an image. The idea is that this model could be applied to detect a fire or a start of  a fire from (aerial) surveillance footage of a forest. The model could be applied in real-time to low-framerate surveillance video and give alert in case of fire.
